# Plant-Disease-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning-ResNet18-
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning (ResNet18) to classify plant leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset. It aims to assist farmers and agronomists in early identification of diseases in tomato, potato, and bell pepper plants.


Dataset: PlantVillage
Source: PlantVillage Dataset (kaggle)
Structure: 15 disease categories + 3 healthy categories
Image Types: RGB images of plant leaves in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png formats.

Example classes:
Tomato_Bacterial_spot
Tomato_Leaf_Mold
Tomato__Tomato_YellowLeaf__Curl_Virus
Potato___Early_blight
Pepper__bell___Bacterial_spot
Tomato_healthy, etc.
Each class contains 150â€“3000 images of leaves.
