# Plant-Disease-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning-ResNet18-
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning (ResNet18) to classify plant leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset. It aims to assist farmers and agronomists in early identification of diseases in tomato, potato, and bell pepper plants.
